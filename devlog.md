Today I created a github and have plans to get logger.c++ done
logger.c++ purpose is to create a logger program for writing log entiries to a file.
It will take 1 command line arguement and Which is the log file name and it reads log messages from standard input.
it writes log messages in this format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM [ACTION] MESSAGE
it stops running when you type [QUIT]
Log file doesnt: show a menu, encrypt anything, interact with user, validate encryption input
